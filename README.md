# Note
This repository for one of my blog post posted on LogRocket which can be found [here](https://blog.logrocket.com/interacting-smart-contracts-via-nodejs-api/).

The title of the post is `Interact with smart contracts via React and a Node.js API` in which I showed how to develop a nodejs server as a middleware to make ordinary browsers possible to interact with smart contracts without using any third party plugins or extensions such as Metamask.
